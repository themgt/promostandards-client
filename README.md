# promostandards-client

A Ruby client to access [PromoStandards](https://promostandards.org) data from suppliers.

Currently, only interfaces some of the [Product Data](https://promostandards.org/service/view/7/) and the [Media Content](https://promostandards.org/service/view/11/) services.

#### TO DO

- [x] Add tests
- [x] Return `nil` when primary image is not available
- [ ] Provide interfaces to other [services](https://promostandards.org/service/overview/) as well

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'promostandards-client',  git: 'https://github.com/promohunt/promostandards-client'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

```ruby
require 'promostandards/client.rb'

client = PromoStandards::Client.new(
  access_id: 'YOUR ID',
  password: 'YOUR PASSWORD',
  product_data_service_url: 'https://brandedpromoapparel.com/WebServices/ProductDataService.svc',
  media_content_service_url: 'https://brandedpromoapparel.com/WebServices/MediaContentService.svc',
  product_pricing_and_configuration_service_url: 'https://brandedpromoapparel.com/webservices/PricingAndConfig.svc',
  inventory_service_url: 'https://brandedpromoapparel.com/WebServices/inventoryservice2.svc'
)

# Get sellable product ids
product_ids = client.get_sellable_product_ids('version') # pass the version e.g. 2.0.0

# Get product data
product_hash = client.get_product_data('product_id', 'version')

# Get primary product image
primary_image = client.get_primary_image('product_id', 'version')

# Get product inventory
inventory_levels = client.get_inventory_levels('product_id', 'version')
```

## Testing PromoStandards end points

- Add credentials and service URLs to a `ps_configs.yml` (See `ps_configs.yml.example`)
- Run `bundle exec ruby test_ps_services.rb`

This would use the data in the YAML file, make sample requests to all the supplier services and log outcomes. This is useful to
test out the services end to end.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
